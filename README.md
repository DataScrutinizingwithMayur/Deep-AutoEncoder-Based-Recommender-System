# Deep AutoEncoder-Based Recommender System

## Overview
This project implements a Deep AutoEncoder-based recommender system to predict user preferences in a sparse user-product rating matrix to enhance product recommendations.

## Implementation
- **SVD Decomposition:** Singular Value Decomposition for reducing sparsity in the rating matrix.
- **Deep Learning Approach:** Using AutoEncoders, trained with a Masked Mean Square Error (MMSE) loss function.
- **Dataset:** Focused on the MovieLens dataset, involving movie user ratings.

## Instructions
- **Code Components:** Data preparation, MMSE Loss function implementation, and AutoEncoder architecture.
- **Environment:** Google Colab for model training and execution.
- **Process:** Involves data preparation, model training, and outputting recommendations.

## Objective
The goal is to build and train an AutoEncoder that efficiently recommends products or movies based on user ratings, demonstrating the efficacy of deep learning in recommender systems.
